### Welcome to another "featured" profile in GitHub ocean.üòÑ
Hey! This is Mert. It's nice to have you here :)<br>I am a passionate data scientist who had an 8-month-long professional bootcamp training on data science and keep training myself as a full-stack AI developer. ***Data scraping***, ***deep learning***, ***computer vision*** skills and ***generative models*** are the flagships in my fleet. Currently, I am working in an e-commerce company.<br>
My B.Sc degree is mechanical engineering and I had worked in automotive industry for two years but quit my job to follow my childhood passion in computer science. :relaxed: <br>Feel free to send me a message about anything! I would be thrilled to talk about deep learning and computer vision  and especially ***GANs*** and related subjects.

Wish you a journey full of excitements and fun! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
