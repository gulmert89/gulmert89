### Welcome to another "featured" profile in GitHub ocean.üòÑ
Hey! This is Mert. It's nice to have you here :)<br>I am a passionate data scientist who had an 8-month-long professional bootcamp training on data science and keep training myself as a full-stack data scientist. I am *(relatively)* skilled in end-to-end deployment, data scraping, ***deep learning*** and ***computer vision*** skills. Currently, I am an M.Sc student in Data & Information Engineering *(online)* and working as a ***computer vision engineer*** in a start-up.<br>
Actually, my B.Sc degree is mechanical engineering and I had worked in automotive industry for two years but quit my job to follow my childhood passion in computer science as you can see so far. :relaxed:
