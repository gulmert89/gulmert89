### Welcome to another "featured" profile in GitHub ocean.üòÑ
Heys, this is Mert. It's nice to have you here :)<br>I am a passionate data scientist who had an 8-month-long professional bootcamp training on data science and keep training myself as a full-stack data scientist who is skilled in end-to-end deployment, data mining/scraping, creating deep learning models and computer vision skills. Currently, I am an online M.Sc student in Data & Information Engineering.<br>
Actually, my BSc degree is mechanical engineering and I'd worked in automotive industry for two years but quit my job to follow my childhood passion in computer science as you can see so far. :relaxed:
